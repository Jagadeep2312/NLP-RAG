# 📘 Machine Learning & NLP Project (RAG-Based QA System)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based **Question Answering system** using **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.
The system extracts knowledge from a PDF document and answers user queries intelligently.

It is designed for **students, beginners, and academic projects** to understand how real-world AI systems work.
